It is a platform and a single pane of glass for all these services. Residents living in the same apartment will Sign up for a same account on Roomie Sync and will add all the common services to this tool, that they subscribe to. All residents will have a single view of all these services. A single account will cater to a group of all the residents living together. As all portals/services will be listed in the same view, the authorized users can easily navigate to these portals without having to remember or bookmark them. Members of the group will get consolidated notifications and reminders from the tool about upcoming bill payment deadlines of the services that have been added to this tool. Roomie Sync will maintain a history and will keep a track of all details of the goods or groceries ordered in the previous months so that the users don’t have to remember the monthly stuff that they order in common. Roomie Sync will also provide easily configurable, flexible dashboards so users can see the information they need the way they need to see it (graphs, calenders, alerts, etc.), and users can quickly set it up.","keywords":"","references":"","business_domain":"","technology_stack":"","code_link":"","is_public":false,"status":"Starred","group_id":{"$numberInt":"30"},"course":"CMPE272","term":"Fall-2018","like_count":{"$numberInt":"0"},"dislike_count":{"$numberInt":"0"},"categories":["Web Application"],"__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}

These NGOs do not know what resources to apply and which best practices to adopt. They often start with paper based system and manual task which becomes tedious. Our aim is to build a platform where people and NGOs can connect for a noble cause.","summary":"We intend to design a platform which would connect NGOs all around and pro-bono consultants and student volunteers who can be of some assistance to the NGO. NGOs registers itself on the platform and list the requirements that they are looking for or the kind of help they are in need of. Similarly pro-bono consultants and student volunteers registers themselves on the platform and they create their profiles where they specify area of expertise, kinds of task they are willing to do, timeline they can allocate for the work etc. We would match and connect the NGOs with student volunteers and pro-bonos using intelligent machine learning algorithms where we will provide recommendations of the appropriate people to the NGOs by clustering them together. The platform can be builts using Nodejs and Reactjs. For the scalability of the server, we intend to use Kafka.","keywords":"","references":"","business_domain":"","technology_stack":"","code_link":"","is_public":false,"status":"Approved","group_id":{"$numberInt":"18"},"course":"CMPE272","term":"Fall-2018","like_count":{"$numberInt":"0"},"dislike_count":{"$numberInt":"0"},"categories":["Web Application","ML"],"__v":{"$numberInt":"0"}}
