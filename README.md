Project Title : 
Smarter Blogs

Project Description : 
Redesign a blogging website to provide smart summaries of each blog in the title card,improve search results and implement autocomplete on search query to help enhance user experience.

Proposed Methodology:
Use Natural Language Processing to enhance the look of a blogging website.
Using bi-gram/tri-gram key phrases,we map each blog with a set of words. This will result in providing better search result.
Using NLTK library (python framework) we implement text summarization. The top 5 important sentences in each blog will be displayed along with it’s title. This will help users get a feel for what the blog is about before going further with reading the whole thing.
The autocomplete feature in the search will help user with better suggestions for their search.

Resources : 
Python, NLTK, Ealsticsearch
